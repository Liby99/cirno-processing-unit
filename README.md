# Cirno Processing Unit

⑨-Bit Cpu Design for Cirno.

[Final Report](https://github.com/Liby99/cirno-processing-unit/raw/master/doc/output/report.pdf)

## Why Cirno?

Since Cirno is ⑨ we can only design her a ⑨-bit CPU and nothing else to help her when she is teaching her math class.

## What have we done

1. Test Programs: Hamming Decoding and Encoding, Pattern Finding
2. ISA Design
3. Assembler that can assemble assembly in our language to machine codes
4. CPU Simulator that can run the machine codes
5. CPU Debugger & Profiler that can help debug the machine codes
6. The ⑨-Bit Cpu written in System Verilog
